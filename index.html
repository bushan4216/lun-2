                <p> The tiger, Panthera tigris, one of the world's most magnificent and revered animals, faces possible extinction in the wild. Since the turn of the century, its habitat and numbers have been reduced by 95 percent.
                    For a million years the "King of the Jungle" lorded over a territory stretching from eastern Turkey to the Russian Far East, its forest home extending northward to Siberia and southward into Bali. in this century
                    alone, the Bali, Javan, and Caspian tigers have become extinct. Tragically, the remainig five sub-species are at risk of meeting the same fate. The tiger faces an onslaugt of poaching throughout its range. In the 
                    1990s, hundreds of tigers have been killed to meet the demand for their bones and other parts, which are used for traditional medicines in China, Taiwan, and Korea, and exported to Chinese communities all over the
                     world, including those in Australia, Europe, and the USA.</p>
